# Issue-Tracker

Inspired by GitHub, Issue-Tracker is an open-sourced project designed to help teams track and manage issues for their software. Users can create organizations to help manage all their members, as well as assign users to certain projects. The front-end is designed with ease of use in mind so users can easily search and manage issues in a fast, efficient, and organized manner.
